# Programming_Assignment_2: CSV Car Dataset
## Story
This is the 2nd programming assignment, for my data structures class. It was assigned to help understand linear and binary search. 
## What It Does
The primary objective of the project is to have the user get information about a particular car. When the program runs, the user is asked to enter in one, two, or three. If the user enters 1, The program will display a list of cars. The user can scroll through a list of vehicles from a CSV file. Copy and paste the vehicle into the program, and it will give you all the information for that car. If the user enters in 2, the user enters in the vehicle's name, and it provides information about the car. If the user enters in 3, the program will quit.
## Task 2
There is another part to this assignment. We had to get the CSV file into an ArrayList and then convert it to an array. The user would be asked to type one of these numbers: Enter in 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 700, or 1000. It would create an array of the size of the number the user entered. The program will select a random number between 1 and x(number the user enters), and then it will give the user the information on the car that's in that specific index. For example, if the user enters in 10, and the program randomly selects 5. The program would return the information about that car that's in index 5.
